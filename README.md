#### Introduce ONE selected [“free-data-science-book”](https://github.com/chaconnewu/free-data-science-books) with its URL and author/institute information. Explain briefly why you are interested in this book.

**Selected Book :**

**Name :** "_R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data_"

**Author :** Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham

**Url link :** [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/))

**Publisher Name :** O'Reilly Media, Inc

**Why I am interested in this book :**
I am interested in reading this book because it teaches how to use R for beginners like me who have no experience in coding. It guides readers from importing, tidying, transforming, and visualizing data until we can be ready for analysis to make predictions and recommendations. I believe this book can guide me to complete my project in the future. Additionally, the author holds PhD in Statistics and rich of experience in teaching, and now he is working for R-studio, so I believe this book is reliable.
